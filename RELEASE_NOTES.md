# JEB Browser — Alpha Release Notes v0.1.0

> **Publisher:** Enmero Research ([www.enmero.in](https://www.enmero.in))

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Industrial Modern Aesthetic**: A high-performance, minimalist UI designed for precision and focus.
- **Native AI Shadow Engine**: JEB runs a backgrounded, headless browsing layer (The Beyond Protocol) capable of semantic analysis and autonomous navigation.
- **JEB CLI**: Interact with your browser from the terminal. Conduct real-time AI searches and extract structured data using `jeb search [url]`.
- **Discovery Engine**: Intelligent context cards for deep exploration of topics.
- **Privacy First**: Local journey history and bookmarks.

## ⚠️ AI Path Notice

**The AI Path (Autonomous Browsing) is currently in Active Development.**
- While the background engine is operational via the **CLI**, the frontend "AI Path" interface has been decentralized to prioritize stability and focus.
- Future updates will introduce higher-level "Beyond" reasoning layers and direct multi-agent communication.

## 🛠️ Usage (CLI)

1. Ensure JEB Browser is running.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Use `jeb search "example.com"` to invoke the Shadow Engine.
